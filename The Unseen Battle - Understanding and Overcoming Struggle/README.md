# The Unseen Battle: Understanding and Overcoming Struggle

![The Unseen Battle: Understanding and Overcoming Struggle](illustration.png)

Struggle is a fundamental aspect of the human experience, yet its essence is often misunderstood. By definition, struggle is the forceful effort or attempt to achieve something in the face of difficulties, manifesting across our personal, social or professional life.

## Why Do We Struggle?

We struggle for various reasons: It could stem from external sources such as workplace challenges, or internally, may come from personal doubts, fear of failure, or the pursuit of perfection. These external and internal aspects can often intersect, magnifying the sense of struggle significantly.

>At its core, **struggle reflects a gap between our current state and where we want to be** and overcoming it often involves a deep dive into our thought processes and the questions we pose in response to challenges. 

## Our Thinking Patterns

Our thinking patterns play a crucial role in shaping our experiences and outcomes, especially when facing challenges. They can either empower us or hold us back. By recognizing and adjusting these patterns, particularly **the questions we ask ourselves**, we can significantly change our approach to solving problems and overcoming struggles.

Negative thinking patterns, such as catastrophizing, overgeneralizing, or black-and-white thinking, can (unnecessarily) amplify our struggles. 

Recognizing our thinking patterns is the first step toward changing them. Mindfulness and reflection are powerful tools in this process, allowing us to observe our thoughts without judgement and identify patterns that may be contributing to our struggles.

## Reflecting on Our Questions

The questions we ask ourselves in the face of challenges greatly influence our ability to find solutions. If we ask disempowering questions like, "Why does this always happen to me?" or "What did I do to deserve this?" and focusing on blame and being a victim, can trap us in a cycle of negativity.

>Changing the questions we ask can shift our perspective and enable us to explore new approaches and solutions.

Instead of asking "Why this happens to me?", we can ask, "What can I learn from this?" or "How can I grow from this experience?". These types of questions shift our focus from being passive recipients of our circumstances to active participants in shaping our outcomes.

## The Quality of Questions

The essence of thinking is asking questions and **the quality of the questions we ask is directly related to the quality of the answers we receive**. 

The high-quality questions:
- **Promote reflection and deeper understanding**
    - "What is the right question to ask in this situation?"
    - "What are the aspects which are most important and what are the details which are insignificant?"
- **Open up possibilities and creative thinking**
    - "What support can I seek?"
    - "What resources are available to me in this situation?"
- **Encourage proactive problem-solving**
    - "What steps can I take right now to move forward?"
- **Foster growth and learning**
    - "What can I learn from this?"
    - "How can I grow from this experience?"

When we start asking better questions, those lead to new perspectives, which lead to new solutions. This approach will transform our relationship with struggle, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and self-improvement.

Struggle is filled with potential and learning opportunities. Recognizing this is crucial to transforming struggle from a barrier to a catalyst for growth.

**Overcoming Struggle: A Path Forward**

My recommended approach to overcoming struggle:

1. **Accept**: The first step is to accept struggle as part of your journey, a signal for potential growth.

2. **Seek Support**: Struggling does not have to be a lonely journey. Reach out to mentors, coaches, or professionals who can provide guidance, support, and a fresh perspective.

3. **Embrace Learning**: Every struggle brings opportunities for learning. Embrace the learning process and remain open to new strategies and solutions. Ask high-quality questions to shift your perspective and find your high-quality answers which will support you to break out of the loop of struggle.

4. **Practice Self-Care**: Finally, never underestimate the power of self-care. Physical, emotional, and mental well-being are your allies in overcoming struggles. Prioritise activities that recharge your spirit and strength.

# In conclusion

In conclusion, while struggle is part of our lives, it does not have to define us. By understanding its nature, acknowledging its presence, and adopting a proactive and positive approach, we can navigate through struggles more effectively. 

Let's embrace struggle as a stepping stone rather than a stumbling block, paving the way for growth, resilience, and success.
